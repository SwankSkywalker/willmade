## The mindset

"***Who are you?*** "
<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}></div>
This is a question that has persisted my thoughts over the last few years, a few years too long if you ask me (*but you didn't, so don't trip*). Have I gotten any closer to answering that question? Not really. It's okay though. I really spend way too much time trying to figure out every minute detail of how I want "things" to come together instead of letting the rubber meet the road if you will.
<br />
"***So why this and why now?*** "
<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}></div>
The simple answer is *why not?* There is never a better time to start than the present.
***Perfectionism kills progess*** Yes.
