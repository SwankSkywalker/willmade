## The mindset

"***Who are you?*** "
<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}></div>
This is a question that has persisted my thoughts over the last few years, a few years too long if you ask me (*but you didn't, so don't trip*). Have I gotten any closer to answering that question? Not really. It's okay though. The truth is I spend way too much time trying to hammer out every single detail of how I want my work to come together. Instead of keeping that as my norm, my aim is to let the rubber meet the road and see where the process takes me.
<br />
"***Why now?*** "
<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}></div>
The simple answer is *why not?*  
There is never a better time to start than the present.
***Perfectionism kills progess.*** Yes.

If the goal is to progress, then continually repeating the false narrative "only creations that are without fault deserve to be shared" must be abolished within your own mind (when I refer to ***you*** I mean ***me*** too). **You've got absolutely nothing to prove to anyone but yourself**.

I chose this medium because I am someone who gets lost within in my own thoughts... **A LOT**. I figure that articulating some of those thoughts by getting them out in the ether makes it so much easier for me to check them, validate them, invalidate them, or whatever. I want to give them somewhere else to live other than my head, because it can get way too crowded way too fast.

I might be terrible at articulating and writing these in the current moment, but the core idea is what I truly care about. To tie things back into the theme; behind all of this is the thesis that repetition increases confidence, and that is what I am truly after. The cycle of progression, refinement, and applying ideology to all aspects of life. Any way you look at it you must start somewhere, so... **let's start here.**
