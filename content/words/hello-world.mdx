## The mindset

"***Who are you?*** "
<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}></div>
This is a question that has persisted my thoughts over the last few years, a few years too long if you ask me (*but you didn't, so don't trip*). Have I gotten any closer to answering that question? Not really. It's okay though. The truth is I spend way too much time trying to hammer out every single detail of how I want my work to come together. Instead of keeping that as my norm, my aim is to let the rubber meet the road and see where the process takes me.
<br />
"***Why now?*** "
<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}></div>
The simple answer is *why not?*  
There is never a better time to start than the present.
***Perfectionism kills progess.*** Yes.

If the goal is to progress, then continually repeating the false narrative "only creations that are without fault deserve to be shared" must be abolished within your own mind (when I refer to ***you*** I mean ***me*** too). **You've got absolutely nothing to prove to anyone but yourself**.

I chose this medium because I am someone who gets lost within in my own thoughts... **A LOT**. I figure that articulating some of those thoughts by getting them out in the ether makes it so much easier for me to check them, validate them, invalidate them, or whatever. I want to give them somewhere else to live other than my head, because it can get too crowded way too fast.

Welp. That's all I wanted to put out right now lol. I might be terrible at articulating my thoughts in the current moment, but the core idea is what matters. My thesis is that *repetition increases confidence*, and that mindset, that process is what I am truly after. If you want to get good at something you just have to do it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Create, share, refine and create again. That's the beauty in the proccess and no matter how you look at it you gotta start somewhere, so... **let's start here.**
