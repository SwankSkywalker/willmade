## The mindset

"***Who are you?*** "
<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}></div>
This is a question that has persisted my thoughts over the last few years, a few years too long if you ask me (*but you didn't, so don't trip*). Have I gotten any closer to answering that question? Not really. It's okay though. The truth is I spend way too much time trying to hammer out every single detail of how I want my work to come together. Instead keeping that as my norm my aim is to let the rubber meet the road and see where the process takes me.

"***So why this medium and why now?*** "
<div style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}></div>
The simple answer is *why not?*  
There is never a better time to start than the present.
***Perfectionism kills progess*** Yes.
