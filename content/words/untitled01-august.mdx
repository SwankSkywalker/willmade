I want to begin this post by posing a question: ***How delulu are you?***<br /><br />Lately I've been thinking **"what's the throughline between those I consider to be the most influential characters in my life?"**. After combing through plenty of interviews, podcasts, and articles (I'll link them throughout this post) it finally hit me. Can you guess what is was? DING DING DING! You're correct! All of them, to some degree, are *crazy* as hell! Now I'm not saying they're the kind that should be admitted to a mental health clinic (which there's absolutely nothing wrong with that), but they definitely think in ways that might have you questioning their sanity like "**is this person genuinely okay?**".<br /><br />These cultural savants, as I like to call them (never called them that before this lol), possess mental models which promote the unshakable belief in *themselves* and their *ideas* above all else, even when the rest of the world sees what they strive to acheive as *impossible* or just straight up ***delusional***. But you know what? ***Maybe they're onto something***. For the next few moments I'm going to briefly explore some of the paradigms which have made themselves apparent to me.<br /><br />I think there's an oppurtunity to take from these models and work them into the context of our own lives, all for the sake of feeding our experience of course. And you see maybe, just maybe we can harness the power of delusional thinking or better yet; *learn* how to have an absurd amount of delusional belief in *ourselves*. Because everything seems crazy...***until you do it***. <br /><br />Alright. Now that's out of the way lol. <br /><br />Let's dive in.<br /><br />

## Are You That Guy?

Have you listened to **"Don't Tap the Glass"** yet? Oh you haven't? I feel like that's a prerequisite to this post... or maybe Tyler's entire discography in general at this point.
