I want to begin this post by posing a question: ***How delulu are you?***<br /><br />Lately I've been thinking **"what's the throughline between all the people I consider the most influential in my life?"**. After combing through plenty of interviews, podcasts, and articles it finally hit me. Can you guess what is was? DING DING DING! That's correct! To some degree, all these people are crazy as hell! Now I'm not saying they are the kind of crazy that should be evaluated by psychiatrist or anything(which there is absolutely nothing wrong with), but they definitely think in a way that could have you question their sanity. These cultural savants have this incredible mental model of believing in themselves and their ideas when the rest of society sees it as *impossible* or just straight up ***delusional***. But you know what? Maybe they're onto something. And for the next few moments I would like to explore some of these paradigms that have made themselves apparent to me. I think there is great value in taking bits and pieces from these models and applying them to the context of our own lives in order to feed our own experiences. And maybe just maybe we can harness the power of delusional thinking, or better yet having a absurd amount of delusional belief in ourselves. Because everthing seems crazy...until you actually do it. <br />Alright. Now that's out of the way lol. <br /><br />Let's dive in.<br /><br />

Have you listened to **"Don't Tap the Glass"** yet? Oh you haven't? I feel like that is a prerequisite this post... or maybe Tyler's discography in general is the prerequisite.
