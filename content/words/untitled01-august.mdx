**The root word "*journ*" originates from Latin and French, meaning "day" or "daily". Every day grants us another oppurtunity to feed our experience if we are intentional about it.** <br /><br />Lately I have been thinking deeply about influence. To be more specific; who, what, where, why, and how are these paradigms contributing to my experience and what can I learn by applying them to my perspective. Ironically, on the topic of influence, I am not really one to look up to others. It's not that I think no one meets or exceeds my standard for the ideal role model, I am just very selective about whom or what I place my energy into. Our thoughts have so much power and where we place those thoughts influence our journey whether we realize it or not. Nonetheless, there are a few people that I believe embody the type of wave I percieve myself to be on. Alright. That's out of the way lol, let's dive in.<br /><br />
