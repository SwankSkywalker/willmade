I want to begin this post by posing a question: ***How delulu are you?***<br /><br />Lately I've been thinking **"what's the throughline between all the people I consider the most influential characters in my life?"**. After combing through plenty of interviews, podcasts, and articles (I'll link them throughout this post) it finally hit me. Can you guess what is was? DING DING DING! That's correct! To some degree, all these people are *crazy* as hell! Now I'm not saying they're the kind of crazy that should be checked by psychiatrist (although there's absolutely nothing wrong with that at all), but they definitely think/act in a way that could have you question their sanity. These cultural savants, as I like to call them, have this incredible mental model which promotes believing in themselves and their ideas above all else even when the rest of society sees what they seek as *impossible* or just straight up ***delusional***. But you know what? Maybe they're onto something and for the next few moments I'm going to explore some of these paradigms which have made themselves apparent to me. I think there's great value in taking bits and pieces from these models and applying them to the context of our own lives for the sake of feeding our experiences. And maybe, just maybe we can harness the power of delusional thinking or better yet; learn to have an absurd amount of delusional belief in *ourselves*. Because everthing seems crazy...***until you actually do it***. <br />Alright. Now that's out of the way lol. <br /><br />Let's dive in.<br /><br />

## How to be Sucka Free

Have you listened to **"Don't Tap the Glass"** yet? Oh you haven't? I feel like that is a prerequisite to this post... or maybe Tyler's entire discography in general at this point.
