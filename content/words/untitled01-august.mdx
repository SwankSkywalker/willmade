I want to begin this post by posing a question: ***How delulu are you?***<br /><br />Lately I've been thinking **"what's the throughline between those I consider to be the most influential characters in my life?"**. After combing through plenty of interviews, podcasts, and articles (I'll link them throughout this post) it finally hit me. Can you guess what is was? DING DING DING! You're correct! All of them, to some degree, are *crazy* as hell! Now I'm not saying they're the kind that should be admitted to a mental health clinic (for the record, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that), but they definitely think in ways that might have you questioning their sanity like "**is this person genuinely okay?**".<br /><br />These cultural savants, as I like to call them (never called them that before this lol), possess mental models which promote the unshakable belief in *themselves* and their *ideas* above all else, even when the rest of the world sees what they strive to acheive as *impossible* or just straight up ***delusional***. But you know what? ***Maybe they're onto something***. Over the next few posts I'm going to explore some of the paradigms which have had the most impact in how I approach the art of creation.<br /><br />I think there's an oppurtunity to take from these models and work them into the context of our own lives, all for the sake of feeding our experience of course. And you see maybe, just maybe we can harness the power of delusional thinking or better yet; *learn* how to have an absurd amount of delusional belief in *ourselves*. Because everything seems crazy...***until you do it***. <br /><br />Alright. Now that's out of the way lol. <br /><br />Let's dive in.<br /><br />

## Act I - Admire your past, but don't chase it.

Have you listened to [**"Don't Tap the Glass"**](https://www.donttaptheglass.com/) yet? I feel like that's a prerequisite to this post... or maybe Tyler's entire discography at this point. Recently, an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnj1zy1Cz5Q) dropped between Tyler Okonma, better known as [Tyler, the Creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_the_Creator), and Apple Music's [Zane Lowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Lowe). I've played this conversation on repeat for the past couple of weeks since Okonma's latest album release because it's that special. Something I love about Zane's interview format is the commitment to curating a space that allows for pure authenticity with his guest. Now, when you pair this environment with Tyler's natural dispostion, the conversation becomes a unique look into the mind of arguably one of the most influential multi-hyphenates of our time. If you have the opportunity, I highly suggest listening to this conversation.<br /> <br />

When is the last time you really analyzed one of your past creations? Do you remember how hard it was for you to create it? Or maybe it wasn't hard at all. What about the context in which it was made? Was your environment different? How about your mental? How did it feel to bring that idea into reality?<br /><br />What I am trying to get at is the almost sure fact that the person who created that piece was in a completely differen space.<br /><br />I catch myself reminiscing about works I created in the past and wondering how to recreate those things in the current tense, hoping that they have the same impact as they once did. It's unrealistic and bordeline impossible. *Why?* Well all these past creations are entries into my life diary that can never be rewritten. As soon as I hit **publish** the ink dries. I often forget that we are always evolving. Things are always changing. ***We*** are always changing. It's what makes anything and everthing we create so special. There will never be anything like it ever again.<br /><br />

## Geez bruv, are we done yet?

Yeah I think it's time to wrap this one up. It's been over 4 months of me trying to finish this thought. Should probably give myself some sort of creative restriction.<br /><br />
So yeah...Maybe that's just it. That thing that you're pouring your heart, your mind, your soul into ***in this moment;*** believe that it will become a reality. It may be uncormfortable, and people may look at you sideways, but ***none of that matters.*** It is *you* who is in control of your destiny, and how you decide to leave your mark on this world. <br /><br/ > So with all that said we can *finally* come to the end. Continue to do what you do, continue to create, remain undeniably delusional, and move *move forward always.*
